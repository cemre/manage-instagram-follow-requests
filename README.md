# Manage Instagram Follow Requests

**Manage Instagram Follow Requests** is a lightweight Chrome extension that helps you organize your Instagram Follow Requests. It shows a banner on profiles that requested to follow you (currently missing from IG web) and auto-navigates you to the next request after you make a decision. 

It's based on the [Manage Instagram Followers](https://github.com/gabireze/manage-instagram-followers/tree/main) extension, that has MIT license. Please visit their Github page to view their sponsored ad. I've removed functionality they offer (see followers/following, unfollow those who don't follow back) to not compete with that extension.
