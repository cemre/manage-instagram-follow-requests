# Manage Instagram Follow Requests

**Manage Instagram Follow Requests** is a lightweight Chrome extension that helps you organize your Instagram Follow Requests. It sorts incoming requests by whether you follow them; then sorts the rest by mutual count (unfortunately it's not reliable when there's < 10 mutuals)

It's based on the [Manage Instagram Followers](https://github.com/gabireze/manage-instagram-followers/tree/main) extension, that has MIT license. Please visit their Github page to view their sponsored ad. I've removed functionality they offer (see followers/following, unfollow those who don't follow back) to not compete with that extension.

## Features

- **Sort** – Requests are sorted by a much more sensible way than how Instagram does it
- **Follow check** – Requesters you follow are prioritized
- **Approve / Deny** – Easily approve and deny requests
- **Search** – Find users by name or username using the search bar
- **Profile Banner** – Automatically shows a banner on profile pages when there's a pending follow request, allowing you to accept or reject without opening the extension
